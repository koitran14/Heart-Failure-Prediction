# :broken_heart: Heart-Failure-Prediction :broken_heart:
This is the repository containing the notebook, data, and report for the Heart Failure Prediction Project which was made for the Artificial Intelligence class at IU! :poop:

There are a few files that you might want to look at here:
* The notebook file which contains all the codes.
* The report file which includes all of our detailed documentation.
* And the actual dataset used in this project!

**P/s: Since this project is still under development, the repository is NOT the final and complete version of our project. There are some problems that we are trying to resolve at the moment (imbalance data, optimizing the model, cross-validation,...) so you should check this repository once in a while to see all the updates! :imp:**
